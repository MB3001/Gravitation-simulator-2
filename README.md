# Gravitation-simulator-2
Gravitation simulator where bodies are all attracted to each other.

My second game made in JMonkeyEngine.

You can move with 'ASDW' and shoot balls with left click. You close the program with "Esc" key.

This will make life easier for those who want to create games set in space, astronomical and scientific simulations, teach physics by giving the program educational applications or simply have a good time playing and improving it through programming in JMonkeyEngine.

You can play it directly by opening "MyGame.jar" in the "dist" folder.

It is built with JMonkeyEngine (http://jmonkeyengine.org/).
